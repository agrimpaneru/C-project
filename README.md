# C-project

As a mini-project for our first semster in C programming, We team of five students have created a simple app which has features to explore cities and hotles along with ratings and prices. The Project name is MINI TOURIST GUIDE. 
You can sort hotels as per ratings or prices , can see the booked history, has booked/hotel full features as well. And yes, a random coupon generator at the end to test your luck and get back your money. Feel free to contribute and give ideas.
